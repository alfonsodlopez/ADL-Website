description: "Why you should sleep more."
---

**"No rest for the wicked".** 

"I can sleep when I'm dead". "Sleep is a luxury, which I can't afford."

I used to say these things. Almost with a sick sense of pride at the misery I'd put myself through. Today, I lament to think on the cumulative self-inflicted harm to my health and mind. To think that sleep was inhibiting my ability to succeed is a thought that could have only persisted through motivated reasoning.

Looking back at snapshots in my life, there are points where I burned out. I could not get my energy to the level I wanted it to be. Focus was hard to achieve. It was impossible to make improvements at the gym. I had weeks where the best I could do was eat and wash my laundry. 

Surely, health requires a holistic approach. In my own life I've made excellent strides toward elevating my quality of life: improving my execise regimens and form, eating better and testing out intermitten fasting, and developing better habits when feasible. Let's certainly not overlook mental healthy. Handling my anxiety has been, without a doubt, the hardest and most rewarding improvement to date. I'm at the highest quality of life I have ever had. Still, there is work to do. Of all the habits developed, the one to get a decent night of sleep eludes me.

Even in 2019, my ability to retain information was not what it used to be 5-6 years ago. I'm in my early thirties! The prime years of my life. It's clear that I was sleep deprived. Sleeping more would help alleviate some of these symptoms. 

I know myself well enough that acknowledging a problem is insuffcient for change. I need to blungeon myself with the research. What are the parameters and what happens if I change them? In essence, what I needed to figure out if it is worth changing my lifestyle. **What is the opportunity cost of sleeping less?** Is it worth the few extra hours that could be used to get shit done, read, exercise, or be with friends?

I've started to look into sleep research heavily. Why do we sleep and what is happening to our mind and bodies? I needed to know *at the molecular level*. This is when I came upon [Dr. Matthew Walker's](https://www.sleepdiplomat.com/) work. He's a biologist at UC Berkeley who specializes exactly on this topic (he taught a "neuroscience of sleep" course I couldn't fit into my schedule back in 2008. I was super bummed, even then, to miss those lectures). He appeared on the [Found My Fitness Podcast](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/matthew-walker) discussing the details of some biological pathways upregulated when you're (not) deep in sleep. Soon after, the [Factually Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/earwolf/factually-with-adam-conover/e/62766524) interviewed Dr. Judith Ownes, Director for the Center of Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston Children's Hospital discussing many of the same points with complementary information. This pushed me to read Dr. Walker's book, "Why we Sleep". It is a tome of knowledge compiling many of the significant findings known to sleep scientists. 

So after all this research what is the consensus?
![Go the Fuck to Sleep](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0072/1432/products/gotosleep_700x.jpg?v=1551179522)  
In the following sections, I attempt to succiently note the findings presented from these sources. Supporting publications are cited where I could find them.

# Why do we need to Sleep

## TL;DR for the TL;DR

* **You can cheat sleep. You can never regain sleep lost. You can never totally repay your sleep debt. Go to sleep.**
* **Based on evidence from more than 100K (yes thousand) studies, total percentage of the populatation, when rounded to a whole number, that can survive on less than 5 hours of sleep a night without showing any sort of impairment, is 0.** [Source](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/jordan-harbinger/the-jordan-harbinger-show/e/57423203)
* For the average individual sleeping 6 hours for a necessary sleep hours doesn't only mean losing 25% of total sleep for a night. Due to how sleep cycles work, it means that you've likely lost 80% of your REM sleep.
* Long term sleep deprivation greatly increases your chances of getting Alzherimer's disease.
* Sleep deprivation starts can come into play as soon as you start sleeping 6 hours of less.
* Don't pull an all-nighter to study. It simply does not work if you don't get the necessary sleep to store and mentally process what you've learned.
* Mental health is impaired when sleep deprived. You become more anxious, your sympathetic nervous system is on alert, and your ability to regulate your emotions is dampened.
* Not only does anxiety rachet up, but so does the feeling of loneliness.
    * And your less attractive to other people. Now you're heading into a downward spiral of lonely. Loser.
* You immunity is compromised after a single night of sleep deprivation, and your chances of infection after a week of sleep deprivation is extremely high, especially around flu season.
* Do everything you can to avoid sleeping pills. They don't put you to sleep. They sedate you. Huge difference.
* My fellow night-owls, the world is cruel to us. Make the best of it. Try to come to arrangements with your work and social circles to live your best life. 

## Deep sleep

* Different stages of sleep are categorized based on EEG recordings of people sleeping. There are very predictable brain wave "signatures" that define the different stages of sleep. 
* Deep sleep clears out the driven force that makes us feel sleepy (listed below)
* We have two main modes of deep sleep, both with many more important functions that are listed below:
    * NREM (non-REM) Sleep
        * Performs the function of moving memories from the hippocampus to the the rest of the brain for long term storage.
        * Resets cardiovascular tone, reducing stress and workload on your heart. 
    * REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep
        * Responsible for the state of dreaming
        * Helps form connections between our memories and knowledge.
        * Helps with learning motor skills.
        * Massive increase in heart rate variability. Having more heat rate variability is considered good for health.
        * Enhances our emotional regulation and ability to read the emotions of other people.
* The average human sleeps 8 hours. This range is normally between 7-9 hours a night.
    * We have 90 minute cycles starting with deep non-REM sleep progressing to REM sleep
    * The ratio of non-REM to REM changes with each cycle. The evening starts non-REM heavy in the cycle, then is more REM heavy toward the end.
    * A person waking up 6 hours into sleep may have lost 2 hours of the total duration, but may have actually lost 80% of their REM sleep.

## What triggers sleep?

### Sleep Pressure
* Sleep pressure: This is the term used to describe the need to sleep.
* Sleep pressure is built up through the accumulation of adenosine. It starts accumulating in the body starting from the moment you wake up.
    * It's a molecule that binds readily to phosphate, and is mostly known for its derivitive, ATP (Adenosine triphosphate), which is used to power most living processes in the body. Important stuff.
    * Adenosine bind to receptors in the brain that builds sleep pressure and supresses arousal. The more it accumulates, the stronger the desire to sleep. 
        * Caffeine works by binding these receptors, and blocks adenosine's ability to 
    * Around 16 hours of being awake, the average person will have built up enough sleep pressure that they will fall asleep easily and stay asleep throughout the night.
    * Try to deny sleep and you will eventually get to a point where you're so exhausted that the body's desire to sleep will take over and you will go night-night. 
    * As you sleep adenosine is removed. Ideally, it will occur during a quite period in your circadian rythm, so you can get uninterrupted deep sleep.

### Circadian Rhythms
* Circadian rhythms
    *  You have a build in clock called the super chiasmatic necleus (SCN). It is located in the hypothalamus.
        * Sidenote: Even with the master clock sitting in the SCN, every cell in the body has a 24 hour clock of its own performing their own functions.
        * Starting in the evening, the SCN will stimulate the pineal gland to produce melatonin. The presence of melatonin tells the body it's time to shut down.
        * In the morning, sunlight coming through our eyes triggers the SCN to send a message to the pineal gland to turn off melatonin production. 
        * Duriing the day there is virtually no melatonin in the body.
    * Chronotype is a person's propensity to sleep at certain times of the day.
        * **Chronotype is genetically determined.** It is behavior that arises from circadian rhythms based on physical processes. It is not a choice.
        * It can be pulled around 30-45 minutes, but not much more than that.
        * We have a fairly evenly distribution of chronotypes:
            * 30% of people are morning larks
            * 40% Neither strongly morning or night
            * 30% of people are night owls
            * Sidenote: Many owls will try to go to bed early, but then they stay awake and often think they have insomnia. This used to happen to me a lot in college.

Under normal circumstances, the sleep pressure build throughout the day along with the melatonin build up from the circadian rhythm peak in the late evening signaling time to sleep. 

## Learning and Memory

* Pulling an all-nighter decreases learning capacity up to 40%.
* We move memories from the hippocampus to the cortex for long-term storage. You cannot cheat sleep on either side. You need to sleep before in order to allow for effective short-term memory, and sleep afterward to move it to long term storage. We know from studies in mice that when we sleep, our memories of the day are replayed at 10-20x during deep, non-REM sleep. We can now see this in humans.
* Sounds coupled with certain learning, then played at sub-awakening volumes to contextually strengthen memories during sleep. During REM sleep, we create connections with the information we have retained with other information we have already learned. These connections are seemingly random. They are often not the apparent connections. They are leaps of association. Like jumping straight to page 20 of Google results. 
    * "Deep sleep is about knowledge, REM sleep is about wisdom". 
* How exposure to certain smells while learning, then again during sleep also create a similar reinforcement in memory while we sleep.

## Physical Health

### Immunity
* Shorter durations of sleep can reduce the effect of natural killer T-cells by up to 70%. Studies have been conducted where people are allowed only 4 hours of sleep, then their killer T-cell activity is measured. This effect can take place within only 1 night of sleep deprivation. Which implies that chronically sleep derived people have higher cancer risks. 
* People getting less than 6 hours of sleep per night are 4x more likely to get infected after being exposed to influenza. This is because peopel who are sleep deprived have a weakened immune response. The antibody response is about half the normal amount. It largely renders the flu shot useless.

### Glucose Regulation
* Poor sleep overall increases sickness rates, impairs glucose metabolism, decreases testosterone levels. You can measure this within days for a person who is getting less than 5 hours of sleep a night. This is equivalent to aging 10 years.
* Beta cells in pancreas become less sensitive to glucose, and other cells in the body become less sensitive to insulin when sleep deprived.
* Importance of deep slow-wave sleep. Starts to decrease in 20s, cut in half by 50s and almost undetectable by our 80s

### Alzheimer's Disease
* People deprived of sleep for 36 hours show an increase of amyloid-beta in their cerebrial spinal fluid up to 30% showing us that slow-wave sleep is important in the clearing of amyloid-beta. Glimphatic system is the lymphatic system of the brain. These cells shrink by ~60% during sleep while they are cleaning the brain. The cleaning solution is the cerebrial spinal fluid. You get a 10-20x increase of this fluid during sleep. One of the things it removes is beta-amyloid. You need to get deep sleep in order to clear it out. However, the problem with alzhimer patients is that the build up occurs in the prefrontal cortex (just behind the eyes) where deepsleep is initiated.

### Exercise and Weight Management

* People who are sleep deprived then to eat 200-300 more calories per sitting and have a desire for more caloric rich foods. Tracks well with a metabolic disorder for people with sleep deprivation issues.
    * Side Note: The difference in caloric expenditure at rest versus being asleep for an 8 hour period is ~140 calories. Contrary to popular belief, you body and brain are very active during sleep.
* Poor sleep affects the gut microbiome
* 
* A cup of coffee in the evening will cut deep sleep by up to 20%, an equivalent of aging 10-15 years over time.

## Mental Health
* Loneliness can be exacerbated by sleep loss, people have been shown to disance themselves from interactions with other people, and in turn are shunned by others. 
    * Lonliness is a killer. It increases your mortality risk by ~45%, twice as high as obesity. 
    * Loneliness effects gene expression, including upregulation of many pro-inflammatory pathways. When sleep-deprived, we are more likely to see objects/people approaching us as threats much sooner than when we are well rested, likewise, the theory of mind portion of the brain which provides pro-social behavior is dampened.
        * **Sidenote: Lonliness has an effect on your immune response. It can change your genetic profile from one of viral immunity to one of bacterial immunity. [via UCLA](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2007-8-9-r189)**

* The amygdala, important for emotional regulation, can be up to 60% more reactive during sleep depravation due to dampening down of the pre-frontal cortex function which would normally control how reactive the amygdala. [Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207017836)
* Genetics plays a role in anxiety and sleep
* Flight-or-flight mechanism is amplified for people with insomnia. Constantly see an amped up sympathetic nervous system in people in insomnia. 

## Glucose regulation

* People who sleep less than 7 hours are more likely to be diabetics
* After a week of short sleep, your blood sugar levels are our of balance with a similar profile to a pre-diabetics using a glucose test to calculate your disposal index. 
* Insulin tells the body to open channels to absorb glucose in blood
* When do you do not enough sleep, the beta cells in the pancreas become insensitive to glucose and does not release the proper amount of insulin
* Other cells in the body become insensitive to insulin and do not open the proper channels to absorb blood glucose.
* Melatonin is responsible for shutting down beta cell production of insulin
* Regulation of blood sugar is inhibited from lack of sleep.
* Hormones lectin and grellin are regulated by sleep. When you do not get enough sleep, lectin is down regulated and ghrelin is upregulated
* Lectin - Regulates satiation
* Ghrelin - tells you that you want to eat more
* This leads to people eating more
* If you put a person in front of a buffet while sleep deprived, you find that people will eat more of all the food groups, but move more toward strachy, high sugar foods (simplified sugars, processed, low sugar)
* Those foods lead to worse sleep, less time, more fragmented, less deep sleep

## Get better sleep

Quality of sleep can be measured as a ratio and amount of deep sleep and REM sleep.

* Depth - Electrical quality of sleep. Think of the "signatures of non-REM and REM sleep.
* Duration - Sleeping 7-9 hours a night.
* Continuity - 8 hours of sleep across a 9 hour period is fragmented, it is not going to be quality sleep
* Regularity - Going to bed and waking up at the same time

In the closing section of *Why We Sleep*, Walker lays out 12 guidelines to follow to improve the quality of sleep in your life.

1. Stick to a sleep schedule.
    * Walker leads with this as his most important recommendation. Adjusting sleep patterns is hard to do. You will be doing yourself a favor in the long run to stick to a schedule, even if you feel the desire to sleep in on the weekends. Regularity is highly important.
1. Don't execerise too late in the day.
    * Aim for no later than 2-3 hours before bed. Exercise can leave your body aroused for hours after a workout.
1. Avoid caffeine and nicotine
    * As a stimulant caffeine makes it harder to sleep and the amount of deep sleep is reduced by 20% which is the equivalent of being 10 years older to have that same reduction. 
    * Caffeine has a half-life of 6-7 hours. It has a quarter-life of 12 hours. If you have a cup at noon expect to have 25% of that caffeine circulating in your brain at midnight.
1. Avoid alcohol before bed.
    * Alcohol is one of the best chemicals we know for REM sleep reduction along with THC (not CBD). 
    * It is a sedative. Sedation is not sleep. Drinking alcohol leads to inhibiting the brain's cortex. 
    * This sedation will keep you in light stages of sleep and lead to it being fragmented. You will be prone to waking up more often throughout the night.
1. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night.
    * Large meals can lead to digestive issues. Liquids lead to awakening to urinate.
1. Be aware of you medication.
    * Some medicines (prescribed and over-the-counter) and herbal remedies can disrupt sleep. Speak with your doctor of pharmacist to see if there are alternatives or if you can take them earlier in the day.
1. Avoid napping late in the day. It can make it hard to sleep at night.
1. Relax before bed time.
    * Being tensed or aroused before bed can make it difficult to sleep. It's important to have time to unwind.
1. Take a hot bath before going to bed.
    * Hot baths not only help you relax, but more importantly, they help raise your body temperature. Once you get out of the shower and cool down it generally cues your body to sleep. Temperature can manipulate the production of slow-wave sleep by even fractions of a degree. Your body needs to drop it's core temperature about 1 degree celsium for it to go to bed. We do not get the raising temperature of the day to activate us as we use to since we are thermaly regulated around 70F in most environments. Then we go home and it is still at at a regulated temperature. Since we do not allow the environment to manipulate our core temperature as in times past, we do not get the environmental cue that it is time to sleep.
1. Get your bedroom in order.
    * More darkness, 3-4 hours before bed start decreasing the saturation of light. Reducing melatonin production and REM sleep. Hour of reading on an iPad compared to regular book saw a 20% reduction in melatonin production and the peak of melatonin came 3 hours laters than in non-iPad readers. People who read iPad did not feel as refreshed. Most people are getting higher amounts of anxiety due to their connection to connected devices. Hour before bed stop looking at devices.
    * Get the right temperature, if possible. 63-66 degrees fahrenheit is optimal for sleep. You can wear socks.
    * Leave screens outside of the bedroom.
        * No phones. No TV. No iPads.
1. Expose yourself to sunlight.
    * Sunlight exposure helps to regulate production of excess melatonin. This will encourage wakefulness during the day. At night reduce exposure to light to encourage production of melatonin which will help you feel sleepy.
1. If you can't fall asleep, don't stay in bed. 
    * Do not associate the bed with staying awake.
    * If you're awake more than 20 minutes, go for a walk or to another room. Get out of bed and read a book in dim light. Return when you're feeling sleepy.
    * Anxiety can make it hard to fall asleep and lead to negative associations with your bed. Get out of the room and try to do something soothing.

## Treatments
* CBT has been found to be better than sleeping aids and alcohol
* High-dose CBD as of the time of this writing seems to help people sleep.
* **Sleeping pills do not help people to get restful sleep.** It works on the GABA receptor. They sedate the brain. Sedation does not give the same sleep signature as REM sleep does. You will wake up with grogginess. It has been found that the brain will __unwire__ itself while using sleeping aids/pills. Avoid sleeping aids unless it is a last resort to chronic sleep deprivation.
    * Ambien induced sleep decreases connections formed from learning during the day up to 50%, done in rats for neuroplasticity.

## Miscellaneous Tidbits
* Don't wear shades in the morning. Let natural light hit your eyes in the morning without shades on. Humans have a retinal mechanism (see the circadian rhythm section) that goes from the thalamus into hypothalamus that regulates your circadium rythm. Use shades in the afternoon to encourage the production of melatonin.
